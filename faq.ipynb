    "FAQ - Bank Churn Prediction\n",
    "Q1. How should one approach the Bank Churn project?\n",
    "Before starting the project, please read the problem statement carefully and go through the criteria and descriptions mentioned in the rubric.\n",
    "Once you understand the task, download the dataset and import it into a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab to get started with the project.\n",
    "To work on the project, you should start with data preprocessing and EDA using descriptive statistics and data visualization.\n",
    "Once the EDA is completed and the data is preprocessed, you can use the data to build a model, check its performance based on the desired metric, and if it is not good then train other neural networks.\n",
    "You should find the optimal value of the threshold using the ROC-AUC curve and use this threshold to covert probabilities into labels.\n",
    "You should include all the models that you have trained in your notebook. \n",
    "It is important to close the analysis with key findings and conclusions.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. I keep getting the following error while installing TensorFlow\n",
    "ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _pywrap_tensorflow_internal: The specified module could not be found. Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime.\n",
    "How to fix the above error?\n",
    "You have installed a recent version that supports CPU and GPU both and you don't have the correct version of CUDNN and CUDA libraries installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please try the below solutions one by one and see if any of them work:- \n",
    " \n",
    "Solution 1\n",
    "\n",
    "First, uninstall the existing TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "!pip uninstall tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "For re-installation, download this TensorFlow wheel file\n",
    "Install this in the same Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "!pip install tensorflow-1.6.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 2\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to have Tensorflow Version 2 with the least dependencies, use the below command:\n",
    "\n",
    "!pip install tensorflow==2.0.0b1\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Download MSVCP140.dll, unzip it, and then paste it into the system32 folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link for the file: dll-files.com/msvcp140.dll.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this line of code in your Jupyter notebook cell\n",
    "\n",
    "!pip install tensorflow --upgrade --force-reinstall\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you try using the conda command?\n",
    "\n",
    "conda install tensorflow==1.14.0 (Use this command in your anaconda prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow this article for more details\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use Google Colab for Deep Learning because installing TensorFlow sometimes gets difficult due to system configuration issues.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you download the HTML file from Google Colab?\n",
    "Google Colab does not provide an option to download the HTML version of the code. You can download the ipynb file from Colab and open this downloaded file in the Jupyter notebook. Jupyter provides the option of downloading an HTML version of your code. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Is it mandatory to use Google Colab for this project?\n",
    "No, it's not mandatory. You can use either Jupyter or Google Colab based on your convenience. But make sure you submit both HTML and ipynb files for the project submission. We prefer using Google Colab for Deep Learning since installing TensorFlow is never an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. I keep getting the below error while executing the fit function for the neural network. Why?\n",
    "ValueError: Input 0 of layer sequential_55 is incompatible with the layer: expected axis -1 of input shape to have value 10000 but received input with shape (700, 13)\n",
    "This error is due to the incompatible shape of the input layer. Please pass the input shape in the first layer as follows:\n",
    "v=X_train.shape\n",
    "s=v[1]\n",
    "Model2.add(Dense(number_of_units, input_shape=s, kernel_initializer='he_normal', activation='relu'))\n",
    "This should use a compatible shape for the input layer that prevents the error from occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. I keep getting the below error while running the code on Jupyter notebook Why?\n",
    "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.colab'\n",
    "If you are using a Jupyter notebook, then you need not install google.colab. This library is only used on Google Colab and it comes pre-installed on Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Why does my model have a high training accuracy but low validation accuracy? What should I do to get a better validation accuracy?\n",
    "In the above scenario, your model is probably overfitting. You should decrease the capacity of the model by reducing the number of layers or nodes per layer. You can also try using a Dropout layer between the hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Why does my model have a high validation accuracy and low training accuracy? What should I do then?\n",
    "There are a few possible reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have a small validation set\n",
    "You may have highly imbalanced data in the validation set (Use stratify=True in the train_test_split method)\n",
    "If you use regularization methods such as L2, L1, or Dropout, while the model calculates training accuracy it uses a regularized model but when it tests accuracy on the validation set, it processes your data through an unregularized model. Regularization introduces some noise in loss value during training, because of this the training accuracy decreases more than expected, but while evaluating the model, the model doesn’t use regularization and hence there's no noise, which is why the validation accuracy doesn’t decrease.\n",
    "Q9. Getting error while importing the Optimizers from Keras library?\n",
    "Please try to import the optimizers using the TensorFlow library as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tf.keras.optimizers import Adam\n",
    "from tf.keras.optimizers import RMSprop"
